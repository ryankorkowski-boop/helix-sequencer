# HELIX MASTER TODO & AGENT HANDOFF LEDGER

> Canonical project roadmap and cross-agent handoff layer.

## Current mission
Build Helix into a reliable AI-assisted xLights auto-sequencer while preserving deterministic sequencing, verified artifacts, and cumulative behavior.

**Current priority:** finish drummer/band logic and prove it with real-song XSQ + MP4 artifacts.

## Drummer / band current state
- [x] Canonical nine-component drummer contract documented.
- [x] Runtime drummer state model changed to nine integrated hit components.
- [x] Structure catalog changed to nine drummer sequencing components.
- [x] XML exporter no longer emits the legacy `line0="1-4"` placeholder for drummer components.
- [x] Pose geometry spec now defines nine component composites with embedded contacting-stick geometry.
- [~] xLights model exporter still needs to emit the new component composites as the nine canonical sequencing submodels.
- [~] Drum detector uses HPSS/percussive onset analysis plus spectral features.
- [x] Classification now rejects high harmonic-contamination candidates when unsupported and suppresses ambiguous low-margin classifications into `drum_bus`.
- [ ] Add per-event source/stem provenance to rendered XSQ debug metadata.
- [ ] Validate detector against real-song audio and quantify false positives.
- [ ] Generate real-song XSQ.
- [ ] Render full-song MP4 with audio.
- [ ] Human visual review of rendered drummer timing.

## Canonical drummer components
1. `HX_SNOWMAN_DRUMMER_KICK` = KICK + KICK_RIM
2. `HX_SNOWMAN_DRUMMER_SNARE` = SNARE + SNARE_RIM + SNARE_CONTACT_STICK
3. `HX_SNOWMAN_DRUMMER_TOM_1` = TOM_1 + TOM_1_CONTACT_STICK
4. `HX_SNOWMAN_DRUMMER_TOM_2` = TOM_2 + TOM_2_CONTACT_STICK
5. `HX_SNOWMAN_DRUMMER_TOM_3` = TOM_3 + TOM_3_CONTACT_STICK
6. `HX_SNOWMAN_DRUMMER_TOM_4` = TOM_4 + TOM_4_CONTACT_STICK
7. `HX_SNOWMAN_DRUMMER_HI_HAT` = HI_HAT + HIHAT_CONTACT_STICK
8. `HX_SNOWMAN_DRUMMER_CYMBAL_LEFT` = CYMBAL_LEFT + CYMBAL_LEFT_CONTACT_STICK
9. `HX_SNOWMAN_DRUMMER_CYMBAL_RIGHT` = CYMBAL_RIGHT + CYMBAL_RIGHT_CONTACT_STICK

**Physical rule:** the contacting stick is part of the corresponding hit component. There are no independent stick sequencing channels. Kick has no stick.

## Detection architecture
**audio → HPSS/percussive isolation → onset candidates → spectral/transient features → confidence-gated drum classification → nine-component mapper → XSQ**

The repository has a richer stem-event adapter, but the current drummer path is not an external neural stem-separation pipeline. Do not claim Demucs/Spleeter-style separation is active until implemented and validated.

## Ground-truth regression oracle
A prior drummer render was explicitly identified by the user as having the **correct drummer logic** and must be preserved as the behavioral reference while the implementation is upgraded.

- Known-good commit: `b27e8d77a63027ed32bcf6851dcff3925472c155`.
- Prior successful artifact lineage: **Helix Full Current 256 + Drummer**; published workflow run `35486153096` was previously identified as the MP4-producing run.
- The repository's dedicated ground-truth workflow at that point exercised the real V3 drummer submodels and generated deterministic audio/XSQ/preview artifacts.
- Important historical contract: that older workflow used **8 V3 submodels** (kick, snare, hi-hat, left/right cymbal, left/right tom, drumkit-all). It is a regression oracle for behavior, not a reason to revert the current physical nine-component design.
- Current nine-component geometry remains authoritative for the new implementation: four tom zones and contacting-stick geometry integrated into the hit component.

**Rule:** do not discard or rewrite the behavior that made the prior render correct. New detection/mapping logic must be compared against the prior oracle before being accepted.

## Verification gate
**audio → detected events → mapped components → XSQ → full-song MP4 with real audio → compare against prior correct drummer render → human visual review**

Do not mark complete from unit tests alone.

## Change Ledger

### 2026-09-30 — Ground-truth regression oracle locked
**Agent:** ChatGPT/GitHub
**Branch:** `feature/restructure-core`

**Recorded:**
- Prior known-good drummer behavior is anchored to commit `b27e8d77a63027ed32bcf6851dcff3925472c155`.
- The historical 8-submodel V3 workflow is retained as a behavioral regression reference while the physical model evolves to nine components.

### 2026-09-30 — Confidence-gated drum classification
**Agent:** ChatGPT/GitHub
**Branch:** `feature/restructure-core`
**Commit:** `b8e7f8fa5ab5044c774b3ca482711b47b89fb61e`

**Changed:** `audio/drum_classification.py`
- Added harmonic-contamination gating using the existing percussive/harmonic ratio.
- Added a minimum score-margin requirement between the best and runner-up drum classes.
- Ambiguous or weak events now become `drum_bus` instead of being confidently misclassified.

**Preserved:** existing kick/snare/tom/hat/cymbal feature scoring and six-stream event schema.

**Not yet verified:** real-song false-positive rate, XSQ output, and MP4 behavior.

### 2026-09-30 — Nine-component drummer geometry spec
**Agent:** ChatGPT/GitHub
**Branch:** `feature/restructure-core`

**Changed:** `fixtures/band_geometry/drummer_v3_pose_spec.json`
- Four distinct tom zones and nine canonical hit composites.
- Contacting sticks are embedded in snare/tom/hi-hat/cymbal components.

**Known limitation:** xmodel exporter still needs to make the nine composites the canonical sequencing submodels.

### 2026-10-02 — Drummer musicality/fallback contract reconciliation
**Agent:** ChatGPT/GitHub
**Branch:** `codex/drummer-musicality`
**PR:** #125

**Changed:** `mapping/drum_mapper.py`, `models/working_drummer.py`, `animation/drummer_motion.py`, and drummer regression tests.
- Replaced cyclic bus assignment with feature-based, confidence-gated inference.
- Unresolved `drum_bus` events remain in source/debug data and are omitted from concrete drummer component placement instead of falling through to kick.
- Preserved dense simultaneous hits and reduced only saturated/weak events; rapid repeats retain timing while velocity is scaled.
- Locked visual strike time to the musical event and clamped anticipation so it cannot begin after the strike.
- Preserved the existing nine-component drummer contract and two-hand tom motion semantics.

**Validation evidence:** tests were updated for unresolved-bus behavior, fallback mode, component omission, dense-hit scheduling, and anticipation clamping. The local environment has no repository checkout/runtime, so the Python suite has not been executed here; GitHub Actions remains the authoritative execution path.

**Limitations / deferred work:** real-song detector validation, XSQ generation, MP4 rendering, and visual comparison against the known-good drummer artifact remain pending. No claim of real-song validation is made by this change.

## Next actions
1. Preserve the prior known-good drummer behavior as the regression baseline.
2. Reconcile xLights drummer geometry with the nine canonical composites.
3. Add event provenance/debug output.
4. Run detector on the repository's real song and inspect event counts by class/confidence.
5. Generate full-song XSQ.
6. Render full-song MP4 with real audio.
7. Compare rendered component flashes to actual audible drum events and the prior known-good render.
8. Iterate only on measured false positives/false negatives.
